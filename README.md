# Landing-Page-FreeCodeCamp
Third Project about Responsive Web Design Certification from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/">Free Code Camp</a>.

## Objective

1. Build a CodePen app that is functionally similar to <a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL">this</a>. 
2. I can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete this project.

## User Stories

1. My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".
2. Within the header element it should be an image with a corresponding id="header-img". I've made a company logo to include in this element.
3. Within the #header element it should be a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".
4. There should be at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class .nav-link.
5. When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
6. I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".
7. My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".
8. Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.
9. The #email input field should have a placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
10. The #email input field should use HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
11. Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".
12. When the input with the id of #submit is clicked, the email should be submitted to a static page (You should use this <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit">mock URL</a> provided by freeCodeCamp).
13. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
14. My product landing page should have at least one media query.
15. My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
